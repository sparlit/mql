# 🌌 Autonomous MT5 Autotrader (100% FOSS)

Welcome to the ultimate autonomous trading solution for MetaTrader 5. This project provides a robust, zero-stub, production-ready system that leverages the power of Python's scientific stack to drive high-probability trading decisions in MT5.

## 🌟 Overview & Philosophy
This system is built on the principle of **High-Probability Autonomous Trading**. It is designed to be a "Set and Forget" model that minimizes human error while maximizing consistent profits through rigorous multi-strategy verification.

- **Zero Stubs Policy:** Every function, bridge, and UI element is fully implemented. No placeholders.
- **Double Verification:** No trade is taken unless multiple strategies across multiple timeframes (M15, H1, D1) reach a weighted consensus.
- **Risk-First Approach:** Position sizing is auto-calculated based on live account equity and market volatility (ATR).

---

## 🏗 Detailed Architecture
The system consists of two main pillars connected by a low-latency bridge:

### 1. MetaTrader 5 (The Executor)
- **Dashboard UI:** A custom-built grid system that renders directly on the chart using CCanvas/CChartObject. It provides real-time status updates on trend, signal, and connection health.
- **Bridge Client:** A custom MQL5 class (`SocketClient.mqh`) using direct Windows WinAPI (`ws2_32.dll`) calls to communicate with the Python engine via TCP.
- **Trade Execution:** Handles order placement, stop-loss/take-profit management, and autonomous trailing logic.

### 2. Python Engine (The Brain)
- **Data Ingestion:** Fetches real-time and historical data from multiple sources (Yahoo Finance, etc.) across multiple timeframes.
- **Strategy Master:** Processes data through four distinct strategies:
    - **Trend Following:** MACD/EMA crossover.
    - **Mean Reversion:** RSI overbought/oversold logic.
    - **Breakout:** Price action analysis relative to Bollinger/Donchian bands.
    - **Scalping:** High-frequency SMA/Price action logic.
- **Risk Manager:** Analyzes market regime (Volatility vs. Range) and calculates optimal lot sizes.

## 🛠 Installation Guide

### Phase 1: Python Environment Setup
1. **Python Version:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed.
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy yfinance scipy statsmodels scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Run the Engine:**
   ```bash
   python Python/main_engine.py
   ```
   - Keep this terminal open. It acts as the server for your MT5 EA.

### Phase 2: MetaTrader 5 Setup
1. **Open MT5 Data Folder:** In MT5, go to `File > Open Data Folder`.
2. **Copy Files:**
   - Copy `MQL5/Experts/AutonomousTrader.mq5` to `MQL5/Experts/`.
   - Copy all files from `MQL5/Include/` to `MQL5/Include/`.
3. **Enable DLL Imports:**
   - Go to `Tools > Options > Expert Advisors`.
   - Check **"Allow DLL imports"**. This is critical for the Socket Bridge to function.
4. **Compile:**
   - Open `AutonomousTrader.mq5` in MetaEditor (F4).
   - Press **Compile (F7)**.

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

When you attach the EA to a chart, the following parameters are available:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `InpRiskPercent` | 1.0 | % of account balance to risk per trade. |
| `InpMagicNumber` | 123456 | Unique ID for the EA's orders to avoid conflicts. |
| `InpStopLoss` | 200 | Initial SL in points (e.g., 20.0 pips on a 5-digit broker). |
| `InpTakeProfit` | 400 | Initial TP in points. |
| `InpTrailingSL` | true | If true, SL will move in favor of the trade. |
| `InpTrailingTP` | true | If true, TP will move to capture more profit during trends. |
| `InpTrailingStep` | 50 | Minimum price movement (in points) before trailing triggers. |

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Deployment:** Drag the `AutonomousTrader` EA onto any chart (e.g., EURUSD).
2. **Dashboard Monitoring:**
   - **Symbol:** Shows the current trading pair.
   - **TF Analysis:** Indicates that M15, H1, and D1 are being scanned.
   - **Trend (H1):** Shows the macro trend detected by the engine.
   - **Signal (Weighted):** Displays the consensus (e.g., `BUY (10)`). A value >= 8 is required for verification.
   - **Autonomous Status:**
     - `Connecting...`: Attempting to reach Python engine.
     - `WAITING CONFIRMATION`: Scanning for high-probability setups.
     - `TRADE VERIFIED`: Criteria met, trade execution in progress.
     - `CONN ERROR`: Python engine is not running or port 5555 is blocked.
3. **Hands-Off Operation:** Once the status shows "WAITING CONFIRMATION", the system is fully autonomous. It will refresh analysis every 60 seconds and execute trades without further input.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- **"CONN ERROR" on Dashboard:**
  - Ensure `main_engine.py` is running and says "Listening for MT5 signals...".
  - Check if Windows Firewall is blocking Port 5555.
- **No Trades Taken:**
  - The system requires a high consensus score (>= 8). In ranging markets, it may stay in "WAITING CONFIRMATION" for extended periods to protect your capital.
- **Wrong Symbol Data:**
  - The engine automatically maps 6-digit forex symbols (e.g., `EURUSD`) to Yahoo Finance format (`EURUSD=X`). If using non-forex symbols, ensure they match Yahoo Finance tickers.
